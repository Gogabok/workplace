                  First, it will check if your case can be assessed based on your information and the
                  documents you provide. If not, the European Financial Regulator clarifies the facts.
                  To this end, he asks for the opinion of the company concerned. In most cases, the
                  European Financial Regulator sends your complaint letter to a controlled company.

                  The company reports to the European Financial Regulator in detail and explains the
                  reasons for its decision.

                  If the audit shows that the company's decision is not undesirable from a supervisory
                  point of view, the European Financial Regulator will inform you about it.

                  If it turns out that the European Financial Regulator must intervene as a supervisory
                  authority, it will continue to deal with the relevant company. However, the European
                  Financial Regulator cannot inform you of the outcome of this dispute, as this is
                  a confidentiality obligation.
